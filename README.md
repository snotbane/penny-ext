# Penny Scripting Language

This extension provides syntax highlighting for Penny (`.pen`) scripts. See the full implementation of Penny for Godot [here](https://github.com/snotbane/penny_godot).

Penny is still in development and will continue to change until I feel like it's done.

### Features

- Syntax Highlighting
- Word Count (single script)
    - When editing a Penny script, this will show a word counter in the status bar, which counts all words included in visible text.

### Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

- Find References
- Word Count (workspace)
